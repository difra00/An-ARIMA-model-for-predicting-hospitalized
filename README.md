# An-ARIMA-model-for-predicting-hospitalized
This code is an implementation of an ARIMA model applied to the forecasting of the COVID-19 hospitalized. The data that were used are taken from a public repository 
(here on github) which belongs to the italian civil protection, and which is adjourned every day, with the purpose of the spread of information.
The first part of the code is a definition of the data, and the most important functions used within the ARIMA model, and it is also defined an algorithm, which is important to find the number of days used to make the predictions, and the number of days to use in order to make the predictions. This algorithm can be seen as a grid search algorithm, fundamental to conduct this analysis. In the second part is implemented a sliding window algorithm. In fact having obtained our hyperparameters now we can make all the predictions we want, and to be more accurate we use the sliding window method. In the output we display our tables and plots that refer to our prediction, and if we are trying to predict past days, we also obtain a performance of our predictions.
